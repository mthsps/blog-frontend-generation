Blog built during the bootcamp of Generation Brazil, using Angular and Bootstrap, and deployed with Netlily. It allows you to create, retrieve, edit and delete posts, and create and edit users. Each post can be related to one theme.

The page can be accessed [here](https://blog-angular-generation.netlify.app/).

It is connected with a backend also developed during the bootcamp, whose repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mthsps/blog-backend-generation/).

### Possibile improvements

The blog was built for learning purposes and therefore lacks many aspects of a blog, such as images and comments. It would be important to improve security and implement cookies or sessions for better user experience. These features could be added with more time and adaptations in the current project.
